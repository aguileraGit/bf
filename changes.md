#### Changes for v0.2
- ~~Flip relay footprint over. PDF shows bottom view.~~
- ~~Add other pin to relay.~~
- ~~Relay make pads larger~~
- ~~RaspberryPi only uses 40 pin connector. Not 42.~~
- Transistor footprint needs to be slightly bigger.
- ~~Standoffs need to be slightly larger in diameter.~~
- Diode - Email Sam
- ~~ADC - Footprint completely off~~
- ~~Change font on resistors on back~~
- ~~Change screw terminals to bigger size.~~
- ~~Add MOSFETs to enable rPi to be powered from power supply~~
- Add LEDs to relays

- Need to check current usage

#### v0.3
Never ordered v0.3. Moved to v0.4

#### Changes for v0.4
- Relay holes need to be bigger for other relays (not low side)
- D2, D3, D4, D6, D8, D9, D10, D11 need a different Footprint
- ~~Orientation dot needed for U3, U5, U11, U13, U15, U19, U17~~
- ~~Check relays are in order~~
- ~~C12/C13 need to be added to the BOM to 1uF~~
- ~~U1 Orientation dot needs to be bigger~~
- ~~Move C1 text~~
- ~~C14/C15 Orientation. Updated footprint. Double check Orientation.~~
- ~~Jumper needs text~~
- Add fuses to BOM
- ~~Upgrade connector for higher current~~ Updated holes on existing footprint
- Add led to relays
- ~~Change traces to 200 mils(?) 12V and COM~~
- ~~5V not working per RPi standard (pretty sure I reversed it)~~ I did. Fixed on schematics.
- ~~Align mounting holes on right side~~
