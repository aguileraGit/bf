#### Changes for v0.2
- ~~Flip relay footprint over. PDF shows bottom view.~~
- ~~Add other pin to relay.~~
- ~~Relay make pads larger~~
- ~~RaspberryPi only uses 40 pin connector. Not 42.~~
- Transistor footprint needs to be slightly bigger.
- ~~Standoffs need to be slightly larger in diameter.~~
- Diode - Email Sam
- ~~ADC - Footprint completely off~~
- ~~Change font on resistors on back~~
- ~~Change screw terminals to bigger size.~~
- ~~Add MOSFETs to enable rPi to be powered from power supply~~
- Add LEDs to relays

- Need to check current usage


#### Changes for v0.4
